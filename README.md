# Cloning Bluechi in your Laptop to Start the Development Container

First, we need to clone Bluechi repo to use the ContainerFile (build-base below) that Bluechi developers use for development and CI/CD.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:eclipse-bluechi/bluechi.git
cd bluechi/
podman build -t build-base . -f ./containers/build-base
podman run -it --rm build-base
```

- The `-t` flag names the image `build-base`.
- The `-it` flag runs the container interactively.
- The `--rm` flag ensures the container is removed after you exit it.

## Inside the Container

Now that the container image is built and the container is running, let's execute the next steps in this environment, which acts as a "virtualization" environment.

### Building Bluechi with Meson Inside Container

Now we need to clone the project again, but inside the container, and build it using Meson.

```bash
[root@8b9162d77132 /]# cd /root
[root@8b9162d77132 ~]# git clone https://github.com/eclipse-bluechi/bluechi.git

```

## Building All Unit Tests

```bash
meson setup builddir
meson configure -Db_coverage=true builddir  # if you want to collect coverage data
meson compile -C builddir
meson test -C builddir
ninja coverage-html -C builddir  # if you want to generate coverage report
```

## Building All Integration Tests

All files related to the integration tests are located in `tests` and are organized via `tmt`. How to get started with running and developing integration tests for BlueChi is described in `tests/README`.

### Assumed Setup

The project has been built with the following command sequence:

```bash
meson setup builddir
meson compile -C builddir
meson install -C builddir --destdir bin
```

Meson will output the artifacts to `./builddir/bin/usr/local/`. This directory is referred to in the following sections simply as `<builddir>`.

To allow `bluechi-controller` and `bluechi-agent` to own a name on the local system D-Bus, the provided configuration files need to be copied (if not already existing):

```bash
cp <builddir>/share/dbus-1/system.d/org.eclipse.bluechi.Agent.conf /etc/dbus-1/system.d/
cp <builddir>/share/dbus-1/system.d/org.eclipse.bluechi.conf /etc/dbus-1/system.d/
```

Note: Make sure to reload the D-Bus service so these changes take effect:

```bash
systemctl reload dbus-broker.service
# or
systemctl reload dbus.service
```

### Running the Controller and Agent

- The newly built controller can simply be run via:

  ```bash
  ./<builddir>/bin/bluechi-controller
  ```

  It is recommended to use a specific configuration for development. This file can be passed in with the `-c` CLI option:

  ```bash
  ./<builddir>/bin/bluechi-controller -c <path-to-cfg-file>
  ```

- Before starting the `bluechi-agent`, it is best to have the `bluechi-controller` already running. However, `bluechi-agent` will try to reconnect in the configured heartbeat interval.

  Similar to `bluechi-controller`, it is recommended to use a dedicated configuration file for development:

  ```bash
  ./<builddir>/bin/bluechi-agent -c <path-to-cfg-file>
  ```

- The newly built `bluechictl` can be used via:

  ```bash
  ./<builddir>/bin/bluechictl COMMANDS
  ```

## Building a Unique TMT Test (Integration Test in Python)

```bash
tmt --feeling-safe run -v plan --name container
```

The `plan --name container` tells the test suite to use the container variant (the other variant would be multi-host, but that requires multiple PCs). The `--feeling-safe` option is required for the newest `tmt` versionâ€”they want to prevent running locally provisioned tests by accident. But BlueChi's integration tests with containers need it.

You can run one specific test by adding `test --name <regex-of-test-directory>`, e.g.:

```bash
tmt --feeling-safe run -v plan --name container test --name bluechi-agent-cmd-options
```
